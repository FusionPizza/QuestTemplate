# QuestTemplate
Base Project setup to develop for the Oculus Quest

This project was created to be used as a template to build VR Content on the Oculus Quest, it is pre-configured so that you can get started asap. You will still need to have ADB and Android Works installed before using this Template. 

In Project Settings-> Android, there will be a Configure Now Button on a large red banner, click this to finish the enabling of the project.

As well, check Android SDK to ensure that the project has found the correct directories for the Android SDK etc, if not check your environment variables for the correct directory location. (Typically does find the right spot)

I placed this in the templates folder of a source build (4.23.1)
